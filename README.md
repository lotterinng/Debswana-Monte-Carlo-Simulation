Project Overview üöÄ
As part of my Business Analytics Portfolio, I conducted this project to explore Debswana's electricity consumption patterns and assess the alignment with Botswana's production capacity. The project includes various data analysis and modeling techniques to uncover potential risks, opportunities, and recommendations in energy management.

Key Features üìã
Data Analysis and Visualization:
Analysis of historical electricity consumption and production trends.

Monte Carlo Simulation:
10,000 simulations to project future electricity consumption based on historical growth rates.
Scenario analysis for high, moderate, and low-growth cases.
Insights into potential strains on the electricity grid.

Regression Analysis:
Implementation of multiple regression models, including Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression.
Analysis of model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).


Sensitivity Analysis:
Examination of the impact of varying growth rates on projected electricity consumption.
Insights into the resilience of consumption growth against different conditions.

Technology Stack üíª
Python: Main programming language used for analysis and modeling.
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels.
Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks for detailed analysis and visualizations.

Project Highlights ‚ú®
Monte Carlo Simulations demonstrated the potential rise in Debswana‚Äôs consumption to 640 GWh by 2033 under a high-growth scenario.
Regression Models achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12.3 GWh with Ridge Regression, providing reliable forecasting for strategic planning.
Insights into Botswana‚Äôs Second Transitional Development Plan emphasize the importance of transitioning mines like Debswana to renewable energy sources.
Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
The insights from this analysis are based on data collected from public annual reports. However, the projections and computations presented here have not been validated by Debswana or any other mentioned parties. This analysis aims to demonstrate various analytical skills and techniques as I venture into business analytics.
